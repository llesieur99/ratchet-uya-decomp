# Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal decompilation

A matching C decompilation of `frontbin.elf` from *Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal* (PS2, NTSC-U, SCUS-97353). The build produces a file byte-for-byte identical to retail (SHA-1 `3bc94ee895e4b4af9b5602a229af599c1103b542`).

This repo contains no game code or assets. To build it you need your own copy of the game.

## Status

1292 of 31316 functions (4.1%) are fully matched. `python tools/pr_check.py` prints the current count for frontbin (the file being worked on). 918 functions are matched fully in C with the rest matched being confirmed handwritten assembly as currently no known compiler or set of flags generates matching assembly.

## Quick start (Windows)

1. Install SN Systems ee-gcc 2.95.3 v1.36 to `C:\tools\eegcc_2.95.3_sn_v1.36`.
2. Put your own `frontbin.elf` in the repo root.
3. `pip install -r tools/requirements.txt` (this includes splat)
4. `python tools/setup_asm.py`. This generates the `asm/` folder from your `frontbin.elf` (it is gitignored, so a fresh clone has none; without it `make` stops with "No rule to make target `asm/header.s'"). It takes a few minutes.
5. `& "C:\tools\eegcc_2.95.3_sn_v1.36\bin\make.exe"`. The last line should be `MATCH: ...`.

Linux and macOS: run `python3 tools/setup_asm.py`, then `python3 tools/build.py --toolchain <dir> --runner <wibo>`.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `localdecomp/server.py` | Local web editor: build one function with its real flags and diff against retail |
| `tools/try_func.py` | The same compile and diff from the command line (Windows, or Linux via wibo) |
| `tools/build_common_c.py` | Opt-in common-level C build with canonical ownership and strict retail-byte gates; see [common-level C](docs/common_level_c.md) |
| `tools/pr_check.py` | Catches the usual full-build failures before a PR |
| `tools/build.py` | The Makefile's build for Linux and macOS |
| `tools/triage.py` | Sorts the remaining functions into buckets (plain, switch, vu0, handwritten, remnant, ...) |
| `tools/build_text.py` | Builds `src/text.c` in address ranges with per-range flags (`tools/text_parts.txt`) |
| `tools/check_match.py` | Compares the built binary with retail |
